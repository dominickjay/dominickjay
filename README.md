# Hi ðŸ‘‹ - my name is Dominick Jay!

A Creative Front End Developer with industry experience of over 5 years. From companies that have clients in local councils to theatre productions, Iâ€™ve been providing quality solutions for both. I specialize in CSS and Javascript technologies - mainly VueJS. Professional experience with SASS, AWS and JIRA.

I'm currently working on my personal website - [dominickjay.com](https://dominickjay.com) - and also a movie recommendation service for my household (as we are awful at picking)

I'm currently improving my knowledge of CSS Grid, and also new design knowledge through the [Design to Code](https://frontendmasters.com/learn/designers-code/) track on Front End Masters.

You can reach me mainly at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dominickjay217) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominickjay/)
