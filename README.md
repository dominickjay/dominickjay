I'm currently working on my personal website - [dominickjay.com](https://dominickjay.com) - and also a movie recommendation service for my household (as we are awful at picking)

I'm currently improving my knowledge of CSS Grid, and also new design knowledge through the [Design to Code](https://frontendmasters.com/learn/designers-code/) track on Front End Masters.
